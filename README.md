In this project, AMI is proposed. AMI is a combined system of smart meters, communications networks, and data management systems which enables two-way communication between consumers and utilities. In general, the conventional grid is having many challenges in fulfill the energy demand and economic efficiency. The need for more efficient infrastructure brought out Smart Grid. AMI is the backbone of Smart Grid, which enables a communication between utilities and consumers. The system has an important aim of collecting the data about energy usage and transmitting the data to utility and conveying it to the consumer, so that the consumer can manage energy consumption during peak hours. Hence, in this project the main focus is to analyze the hardware implementation of AMI using Arduino and MATLAB Simulink. Here an Arduino Mega 2560 is used to collect the current and voltage using the respective sensors. The collected data are sent to an IOT platform (ThingSpeak) through a Raspberry Pi 4 and the stored data can be used for further analysis. This also achieves increased energy efficiency and billing accuracy.
